# Traffic Congestion System
 The programme should be able to identify the vehicle flow from the live video stream and regulate the traffic lights autonomously. The programme should have machine learning capabilities that can understand the location of the traffic light and build a behaviour pattern based upon the data collected.
Expected Outcome: Based on vehicle density, the programme should understand the traffic conditions. The software should be able to communicate with the many cameras in the signal and maintain seamless control over the traffic light.

Concept: Our proposed solution considers the number of vehicles as well as time intervals in a traffic signal. The traffic signals will work based on the highest number of vehicles in a lane and turn green. The lane with the least number of vehicles will have a red signal.

Methodology: There are 3 modules according to the proposed system: Vehicle Count Detection - counting number of vehicles in every lane using image processing Traffic Signal Allocation - allocating red/green/yellow lights to each lane based on vehicle count Time Interval Calculation - calculating time interval based on traffic sign allocation and vehicle count

Feasibility of Solution: Much of the proposed methods used to extracted traffic condition information are based on vehicle detection and tracking techniques. The advantages of this new method include such benefits as use of image processing over sensors, low cost, easy setup and relatively good accuracy and speed. Estimated traffic load on particular road will be used to calculate the required time duration for controlling of signal lights based on in comparison with experimental results. To solve congestion problems is feasible not only by physically constructing new facilities and policies but also by building information technology transportation management systems

Practicality: In recent years traffic congestion has become apparent as one of the major challenges worldwide. The increasing numbers of vehicles not only has a large environmental impact, but also result in loss of lives and time on the road. Our project mainly focuses on improving the efficiency of the traditional traffic signalling system, ie., it will work on image processing based adaptive signal controlling. In case of prototype creation, the approach is practical and straightforward as the components are available in the market readily. But on the other hand, in order to build a real-time system, we need to consider various other factors like cost, feasibility etc,.
